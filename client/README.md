Today's exercise:
Using the todo app we've been building.
Implement an action creator to make the decrement button work.
Create the action type in the types.js file in the actions folder.
Create an action creator called decrement which returns an action.
This action creator should return an action with a  type of DECREMENT.
Handle this type of action in the counterReducer.js file inside of the reducers folder.
Connect the action creator to the Counter container.
